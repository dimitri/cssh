;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs.
;;
;; Emacs Integration:
;; (require 'cssh)
;;
;; cssh bindings to open ClusterSSH controler in cssh-mode on some buffers:
;;
;;  C-=       asks remote hostname then opens a term and ssh to it
;;  C-=       from IBuffer mode opens ClusterSSH controler on marked buffers
;;  C-u C-=   asks for the name of the ClusterSSH controler buffer
;;  C-M-=     matches given regexp against ssh known_hosts and open
;;            buffers in which ssh <remote> is typed
;;  C-u C-M-= asks for a name before
;;
;; Special keys while in the *cssh* controller you might want to know about:
;;
;;  C-=   redraw buffer selection in windows
;;  C-!   reconnect the ssh, for when your ssh buffers outlive the ssh inside
;;
;; Dired integration:
;;
;;  C-=   in dired uses a `dsh' style configuration file to get the remote
;;        hosts list
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;  * add some more documentation
;;
;; WON'T FIX
;;
;; * the line and char modes as in term.el are not a good idea here, as it
;;   seems much better for the *cssh* controller buffer to behave as much as
;;   possible like a plain emacs buffer.
;;
;; CHANGES
;;
;; 0.9
;;  Add support for remote directory tracking with support for bash, thanks
;;  to SÃ©bastien Gross
;;
;;  Base cssh-controler based comint mode, using a dummy special shell that
;;  about does while read line; echo $line; done, but with a prompt.
;;
;; 0.8
;;  Add `dsh' support from the main C-= function, using @group notation
;;
;; 0.7
;;  Add `dsh' configuration file support from dired
;;
;; 0.6
;;  Use tramp to complete the host names
